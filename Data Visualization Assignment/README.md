# IBM Data Visualization Assignment

This project was the final assignment as part of the IBM Data Visualization with Python course.   

The final dashboard demonstrated US Domestic Airline Flights Performance and Yearly average flight delay statistics for a given year ( 2005 to 2020). In this I utilized VS Code to develop and run Python code.
