# IBM Final Project Assignment

This project was the final assignment as part of the IBM Data Analysis with Python course.

In this assignment, I was supposed to be a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust wanted to start investing in Residential real estate. I was tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes/features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. A template notebook was provided in the lab; my job was to complete the ten questions. Some hints to the questions were given in the template notebook.
