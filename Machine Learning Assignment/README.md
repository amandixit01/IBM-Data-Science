# IBM Machine Learning Assingment

This project was the final assignment as part of the IBM Machine Learning with Python course.

In this project, labelled data about weather pattern in Australia was provided from Australian Government's official website. As the data was labelled, the prediction for tommorow was already in the data, and I had to train different models so as to be able to predict whether it will rain tommorow or not given other features.

In this project I utilized Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and K-nearest Neighbour(KNN) models for prediction purpose. And at the end, how accurate different models were was adjudged by different metrics like Accuracy Score, Jaccard index, F-1 Score & Log Loss.
